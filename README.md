# IOT Sensor NFT Conversion on Aerial Console 

To setup a Candy Machine:

- Create your Candy Machine using [Sugar](https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/candy-machine/how-to-guides/my-first-candy-machine-part1) (now supports pNFTs)
- Change token standard to pNFT: `sugar config set -t pnft`
- Make sure you have setup your [Candy Guard](https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/candy-machine/how-to-guides/my-first-candy-machine-part1#candy-guards---further-configuration). _This is a necessary step._

After these, you can use this UI to mint pNFTs.

## Candy Guards supported

- [Start date](https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/candy-machine/available-guards/start-date)
- [Sol Payment](https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/candy-machine/available-guards/sol-payment)
- [Allow List](https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/candy-machine/available-guards/allow-list)
  - Grab your Merkle Root from [here](https://tools.key-strokes.com/merkle-root)
  - Add the Merkle Root to your Sugar config.json:
    ```
        "allowList": {
            "merkleRoot": "e889dfa8fbfb6016378348ca395f243c55a0768647c2ca58e5febffa17e02d60"
        },
    ```
  - Add your allow list wallets to the `allowlist.json` file
- [Mint Limit](https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/candy-machine/available-guards/mint-limit)
- [Token Burn](https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/candy-machine/available-guards/token-burn)

## develop locally

- `yarn`

- Copy and fill the contents from the `.env.template` file into a `.env` file.

- `yarn dev`

## deploy

You can deploy to any provider but make sure you add the `NEXT_PUBLIC_CANDY_MACHINE_ID` environment variable. (_Try [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new)_)

## contribute

You can build guards, or improve the UI, and your PR will be happily reviewed & merged.

Also, I'm accepting tips in SOL to keep improving this open-source project: 52zEuaG5VBQTzRP7MLMyEzSuKgYPF9E9dtaWrmXaiNkg

# Setup your own cmui

You'll need to modify a few things to make this work for your own candymachine on mainnet. <b>Be careful tho, there's no edit undo</b>.<br><br>
Start by changing your `example.env` to `.env`. <b>Proceed with Caution!</b><br><br>
Head over to [Quicknode](https://www.quicknode.com/) and get setup with a free account.

Create an endpoint<br><br>

# Creating a Candymachine 

## Rust / Solana / Sugar

1. Install Rust:
The Solana CLI is built with Rust, so you'll need to install it first. To install Rust, open your terminal and run the following command:
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Follow the prompts in the terminal and agree to the installation. Rustup, the Rust version manager, will be installed along with the latest stable version of Rust.

2. Add Rust to PATH:
After the Rust installation is complete, you'll need to add it to your system's PATH variable. Open a new terminal window or run the following command to apply the changes immediately:
```
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```
3. Install Solana CLI:
Now that Rust is installed, you can proceed to install the Solana CLI. Run the following command in your terminal:
```
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.9.7/install)"
```
This command will download the Solana CLI installer script and execute it.

4. Verify Solana CLI installation:
To verify that the Solana CLI is installed correctly, run the following command:
```
solana --version
```
If installed successfully, it should display the version number of the Solana CLI.

5. Install Sugar CLI:
Sugar is a command-line tool that makes it easier to interact with Solana programs and accounts. To install Sugar, run the following command:
```
cargo install sugar-sdk
```
This command will use Cargo (Rust's package manager) to download and install the Sugar CLI.

6. Verify Sugar CLI installation:
To verify that Sugar CLI is installed correctly, run the following command:
```
sugar --version
```
If installed successfully, it should display the version number of the Sugar CLI.

## Candymachine

Create a new folder in your workspace named `assets`.<br><br>

Create a file in the `assets` directory named `0.json` and paste the following contents:
```
{
    "name": "test",
    "symbol": "DEMO",
    "description": "This is demo metadata for demo NFT collection for devnet.",
    "image": "0.png",
    "attributes": [
        {
            "trait_type": "Type",
            "value": "Demo"
        }
    ],
    "properties": {
        "files": [
            {
                "uri": "0.png",
                "type": "image/png"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
Create another file in the assets folder named `collection.json` and paste the following contents:
```
{
    "name": "tests",
    "symbol": "DEMO",
    "description": "This is a demo collection for devnet UI testing.",
    "image": "collection.png",
    "attributes": [],
    "properties": {
      "files": [
        {
          "uri": "collection.png",
          "type": "image/png"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
```
Modify the metadata for your collection, and an image for your nft to your assets folder called `0.png`, repeating the process for each nft in your collection.<br><br>
Add an image for your collection called `collection.png`.
<br><br>
Run the following commands in this order:
```
solana config set --url devet
```
```
solana airdrop 2
```
```
sugar config create
```
```
sugar upload
```
```
sugar launch
```
At this stage, you'll have a `config.json` where you will be required to add your guards, at least one is required. It should look something like this:
```
  "guards": {
    "default": {
      "solPayment" : {
        "value": 1,
        "destination": "YOUR_PUBKEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
```
sugar guard add
```
Copy and paste your Candymachine ID into your `.env` file.
